This is what the application looks like side by side. Everybody can move the participants on their UI and will get a unique spatial audio scene.

You can also control the spatial audio scene for other participants. When you have the control over the spatial audio scene, you can move the participants around with a simple drag and drop, then the same movement will be applied on the other participants UI.
